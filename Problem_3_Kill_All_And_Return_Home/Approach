Approach:
Input Coordinates: Read the coordinates for the soldiers and the starting position of the castle.
Simulate Movements:
The castle moves forward until it encounters a soldier to kill.
After killing a soldier, it turns left and continues moving.
If the castle jumps over soldiers, it should continue its path.
Track Paths: Store the paths taken by the castle for each unique path it takes to return home.
